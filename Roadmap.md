# Chunky Roadmap

Plans and ideas for future development.

See [[Readme.md]] for general information about Chunky.

- writing corrected text to output, rather than summary of the check
- ignoring Markdown formatting (but not removing it, either)
- adding an argument for segment length
- overlapping segments by a configurable number of words
- a "tokens" argument similar to Pixie
- supporting other LLMs
